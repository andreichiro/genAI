# Introduction

GenAI will change what programming is and all team topologies in technology. More than that, it will change what math, research, and all other white-collar skills are—actually redefining what a job is. The impacts on markets, laws, science, art, politics, and society are already meaningful, and we are just at the beginning.

This is a three-text series that proposes reflections on different domains: the present text for markets and economics, one for upskilling and tool usage, and one for society in general and geopolitics.

These are the foundations I will use in this text:

The first one is Paul Romer's 1990 Endogenous Technological Change. It is an economic framework that formalizes how new ideas are created and how they fuel economic growth.

The second one is the "Solow Paradox," the phenomenon describing that major technological innovations (like computers) did not immediately translate into higher outputs (GDP or the goods and services that a company produces), because firms must spend time and resources redesigning processes, retraining workers, and reorganizing production in order to harness the full potential of technologies.

I will introduce genAI into these formalizations, run some simulations, and try to understand the consequences for companies and markets.

## 1. From "Classic" Growth to "genAI" Growth

> "We must take seriously the economic opportunities presented by the potential for producing new ideas and for diffusing existing ideas to the widest possible extent"
> — Paul Romer

In a way, Paul Romer created a formalization for the idea that we "stand on the shoulders of giants," one of the most powerful human capabilities, by understanding how knowledge production works. In other words, he proposed how new ideas get discovered (the "growth of knowledge") using some intuitive notions:

Knowledge is non-rival: I can use your idea, and that doesn't diminish its usability; rather, the more ideas available, the better it is for generating new ideas.

New ideas come from the current stock of knowledge and from how many workers are doing R&D, multiplied by some productivity factor.

These intuitions underpin Romer's definitions:

**Labor in Final Goods**: The amount of labor allocated to generate the final goods. Labor contributes to output with diminishing marginal returns: if you have 100,000 workers, adding 10 more workers (with the same specialization, role, etc.) will not provide the same gain as going from 1 worker to 11. The more you have, the lower the marginal return.

**Intermediate Input**: Each intermediate input is a specialized machine, tool, or component used to generate final goods. Machines contribute to output with diminishing marginal returns: if you have 100,000 machines, adding 10 more of the same type will not provide the same gain as going from 1 machine to 11.

**Number of Varieties**: The number of different intermediate goods (or designs) available. This directly measures the economy's knowledge or technology level—each new variety is created by the R&D sector.

**No Direct Diminishing Returns to Knowledge**: New knowledge doesn't suffer from diminishing returns in this framework; each new variety can increase output linearly. Existing ideas also make it easier to generate new ideas, since researchers can build on what's already known.

**Combination (Labor and Varieties)**: Labor and intermediates complement each other. Workers need machines to be productive, and machines need workers to operate them.

**Labor Allocation**: Total labor is split between production and R&D. If more labor is allocated to R&D, more ideas are discovered per unit time, all else being equal. The more labor allocated to final output, the more money is generated in the short run.

### How does everything fit together?

In a factory, more workers can increase the number of cars produced, but if the number of machines is fixed, adding too many workers leads to crowding with only small increases in output. The same is true for machines: you can increase output up to a point, but eventually some robots might stand idle if you don't have enough workers or tasks.

Now, think of adding a new type of machine—for example, introducing a brand-new 3D-printing machine (a new variety that wasn't available before). This machine can make certain components faster or produce parts that previously had to be made by hand. The number of varieties is determined by the R&D sector via the knowledge production equation. The more you invest in R&D, the higher the probability of discovering new types of machines for your business, but the less labor is allocated to short-term revenue drivers.

Now add genAI to the mix. Instead of just humans working and researching, we have a combination of software and hardware that can handle both production and research tasks.

By using some formalizations, it's possible to differentiate between a phase where genAI and human labor collaborate (a transition phase) and an era where genAI can operate autonomously, making human collaboration less productive (a full AI phase).

## 2. The Hidden Ingredient: Intangible Capital

### What Is Intangible Capital?

"Intangible capital" might sound abstract, but it's actually quite intuitive once you see it in action. It includes all the non-physical components that make your AI adoption work:

**Organizational Know-How**: Do you have processes that empower those who want to develop innovation? Is the company agile in addressing change resistance, or are there gatekeepers in key positions?

**Workforce Skills**: Do employees understand genAI tools? Can they spot the right problems for genAI to solve? Do they have an experimental mindset? Do they have technical and product skills?

**Culture & Leadership**: Is management willing to take risks and invest in a long-term genAI vision?

If your intangible capital is too low—like a staff that doesn't trust or understand the new espresso machine—you'll struggle to benefit from AI. But once you reach a certain "tipping point," intangible capital can multiply the impact of AI on your productivity.

Rather than energy, data, or data centers, intangible capital is the highest obstacle—and the biggest opportunity. It also explains this famous quote regarding the Solow Paradox:

> "You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics"

Because firms must temporarily reduce output (goods and services) to invest in R&D and intangible readiness, there is a "J-shaped" trajectory: an initial dip or stagnation followed by accelerated growth, triggered once the intangible investments pay off.

### Synergy Threshold (The "Aha!" Moment)

Every organization has a "synergy threshold," the intangible level at which genAI really starts to click, after lots of experiments, investment, training, and changes. Below that threshold, progress feels slow, improvements are modest, and revenue can even drop. Once you cross that threshold, your intangible capital suddenly takes off—the company has learned how to use genAI effectively.

After electricity was invented, it was initially used like a steam engine substitute; it took time to redesign entire factories to maximize the parallelization and productivity gains electricity could offer. That's exactly what I mean by "synergy threshold."

### What Does This Mean for Companies and Workers?

This is why this could be the startup era: small companies can be designed from scratch to employ genAI, and changes happen much faster.

**Startup advantage**: Speed, because there aren't established processes or culture.

**Startup disadvantage**: You have to build everything from scratch, for the same reason.

Big companies, on the other hand, should start early by investing in intangible readiness and trying to hire entrepreneurial talent, offering what startups cannot: the stability to explore curiosity and invent the future. There will be a huge wave of creative destruction, with partnerships between startups and big companies increasing significantly.

One interesting finding is that top labs with AI-assisted research discover 44% more materials, resulting in a 39% increase in patent filings and a 17% rise in product innovation, while labs at the bottom see little or no gain. Why? Without domain knowledge, they're trapped in false positives, exploring useless ideas.

The problem is that, as Y Combinator states, you want to find ideas that seem like really bad ideas but are actually surprisingly good (e.g., Airbnb in its early days). Nobody wanted to stay in a stranger's house via an unknown service provider—until everyone did. An initially improbable business model created new markets.

So companies should create new job descriptions and roles, hiring for curiosity and entrepreneurial skills, and envisioning new positions and career paths (e.g., genAI chief officer, genAI engineer, etc.). For employees, you should start upskilling now because, paradoxically, if genAI partially or completely replaces human labor, the premium rewards will go to those who can combine domain knowledge with soft skills—until labor is entirely transformed.

So there's a narrow window, but also a huge opportunity:

Mastering programming has never offered so much potential, especially if you can combine it with learning how to learn, critical thinking, an experimental mindset, and a product mentality.

Have you always dreamed of learning math, chemistry, or Python? Have you considered upskilling in leadership, creativity, or critical thinking? This is the time!

### Lockout Risk: Don't Get Left Behind

The lockout risk is the probability that an organization (or a region, or a sector) with lower intangible capital will fall so far behind the leaders that it's nearly impossible to catch up.

If the gap in intangible capital between you and the "top player" is huge, your risk of being locked out of that high-productivity club approaches 100%.

If you manage to close that gap, your risk goes down.

In practical terms, it's like trying to gain customers when a competitor already dominates the market, has brand loyalty, the best talent, and can outspend you in R&D. The bigger the lead, the harder it is to bridge it.

## 4. Scenarios, Simulations, and What They Teach Us

### A) Smooth vs. Abrupt Intangible Synergy

A smooth climb means you see a steady, rising benefit from intangible capital as you invest in training, culture, and so on.

An abrupt leap suggests that once you cross a certain intangible milestone, you experience a sudden, meteoric rise in AI productivity—leading to "winner-takes-most" situations.

### B) Splitting AI Between Production vs. R&D

Businesses face a trade-off: Do they use human labor and genAI mostly to boost today's output (automation on the factory floor) or to fuel tomorrow's breakthroughs (directing AI toward research and new product ideas)?

If you direct most of your workforce (and even genAI) toward production, you maximize short-term output but become fragile in the long run.

If you allocate most AI to R&D, you sacrifice some immediate returns but build a much stronger knowledge base that can explode later.

Most companies are not investing in the future, which poses significant risks.

### C) Surprise Shocks: What if Labor Disappears Unexpectedly?

Imagine that, from one year to the next, the need for human labor drops dramatically, earlier than planned. If you're already close to the intangible threshold, you adapt quickly and may even profit from the shock. If you're still far below the threshold, the company simply collapses, left in the dark with no viable fallback.

### D) Sectoral Differences: Software vs. Traditional Manufacturing

We often see software or IT companies adopt new technology faster and invest more in intangible capital—like advanced data systems and highly skilled employees. By contrast, some traditional manufacturers stick to smaller R&D budgets. The result? The software sector can leap ahead once the synergy threshold is crossed, while manufacturers plod along with only moderate improvements.

Sectors that already invest heavily in R&D can take the lead if they redirect this R&D to experiment with how genAI can be used:

**Software and IT Services**: This is the largest R&D field. In 2021, information industries (software publishers, internet/data services, telecom, etc.) performed about $150 billion in R&D, ~25% of U.S. business R&D.

**Hardware & Electronics**: Semiconductors, computer hardware, and communications equipment contributed roughly 17% of private R&D in 2021. In 2022, computer and electronic products manufacturers spent about $104.7 billion on R&D (around 15% of the total). Semiconductors and other electronic components can be among the most R&D-intensive parts of the economy—on the order of 20–24% of sales invested in R&D.

**Biotechnology & Pharmaceuticals**: Another leading sector. Pharmaceutical and medicine companies performed about $105–110 billion in R&D in 2021 (forming the bulk of the ~18% share for the entire chemicals sector). This means pharma/biotech alone comprised roughly 16–17% of U.S. business R&D in 2022.

### E) Boom–Bust vs. Steady Investment

Some organizations pour a lot of intangible investment in early on ("boom–bust"), like investing during the hype and then giving up when tangible results don't appear quickly. Others make consistent, moderate investments. Even if the total amount spent is the same, the steady strategy often crosses the synergy threshold sooner—reaping earlier (and sometimes bigger) rewards.

# AI Economic Growth Model: Equations, Parameters and Scenarios

## 1) Equations Overview

### 1.1. Classic Romer (No AI)
**Final Output (Old Romer):**

Y_old(t) = [L_Y(t)]^(1−α) ∑_{i=1}^{A(t)} [x_i(t)]^α, 0 < α < 1.

**Knowledge Production:**

Ȧ_old(t) = δA(t)L_A(t).

**Labor Constraint:**

L = L_Y(t) + L_A(t).

No AI means no additional φK_AI term in final output, and no γK_AI,R in knowledge production.

### 1.2. Partial vs. Full AI (Adopters)
**Final Output**

Partial AI (Years 1–8):

Y_T(t) = [L_Y(t) + φK_AI(t)]^(1−α) ∑_{i=1}^{A(t)} [x_i(t)]^α.

Full AI (Years 9–10):

Y_F(t) = [φK_AI(t)]^(1−α) ∑_{i=1}^{A(t)} [x_i(t)]^α, L_Y(t) ≈ 0.

**AI-Augmented Knowledge**

Partial:

Ȧ_T(t) = δA(t)^θ [L_A(t) + γK_AI,R(t)]^η.

Full:

Ȧ_F(t) = δA(t)^θ [γK_AI,R(t)]^η, L_A(t) ≈ 0.

### 1.3. Intangible Capital: U_t
U_{t+1} = U_t + I_{U,t} × 1/(1+e^(−κ(U_t−Ū))),

where Ū ≈ 5 is the synergy threshold, κ ≈ 1 is the slope, and I_{U,t} depends on the firm's intangible investment rate (related to R&D intensities above).

### 1.4. Lockout as a Risk Index
LockoutRisk_j(t) = 1/(1+exp{−β(ΔU_{j,t}−Δ*)})

where ΔU_{j,t} = U_leader(t) - U_j(t). If your intangible gap vs. the leader is large, risk → 1; if you catch up, risk → 0.

## 2) Parameter Calibration
We use your Summary Table to set R&D % and intangible investment for each category:

**Top Labs (Elite private R&D labs):**
- R&D ~20% of revenue (very high, typical for "top synergy").
- High skill λ ≈ 0.9.
- Year 0 intangible U_0 ≈ 4.3.

**Intermediate ("Average") Labs:**
- R&D ~4% (matches "median US" from your table).
- λ ≈ 0.5.
- Year 0 intangible U_0 = 2.0.

**Bottom Labs:**
- R&D ~1% or near 0% (since ~80% US firms do negligible R&D).
- λ ≈ 0.2.
- Year 0 intangible U_0 = 1.0.

**IT Sector:**
- R&D 13–20% (per your data: $182B / $900B revenues in some sub-sectors, etc.).
- λ ≈ 0.7.
- Year 0 intangible U_0 = 3.0.

**Usual US Sector (No AI):**
- Classic Romer, no φK_AI.
- R&D ~4%.
- Year 0 intangible can be 1.5–2.0, but it does not feed into synergy or partial→full AI. They remain on the old track. We simply track them as a "control group."

Within each category, we map R&D % → intangible investment I_{U,t}. For example:

- Top Labs: invests intangible = 0.20 × (Revenue).
- Average: invests intangible = 0.04 × (Revenue).
- Bottom: invests intangible = 0.01 × (Revenue).
- IT: invests intangible = 0.15 × (Revenue), etc.

(We scale these so that intangible invests from Year 0 onward in the logistic formula.)

## 3) Year 0 Observations

### 3.1. Innovation Outcomes at Year 0 (Empirical)
**Top Labs:**
- +44% discovered materials relative to pre-AI ⇒ DM_0 = 1.44.
- +39% patents ⇒ PT_0 = 1.39.
- +17% new products ⇒ NP_0 = 1.17.
- AI automates ~57% of idea-generation.
- Output vs. old model ~ +44% as well, so Y_0 = 1.44.

**Intermediate:**
- Possibly +5–10% net gains ⇒ DM_0 = 1.05, PT_0 = 1.03, NP_0 = 1.02, Y_0 = 1.05.

**Bottom:**
- Negligible ⇒ DM_0 = 1.00, PT_0 = 1.00, NP_0 = 1.00, Y_0 = 1.00.

**IT Sector:**
- Some partial AI usage ⇒ maybe DM_0 = 1.20, PT_0 = 1.15, NP_0 = 1.10, Y_0 = 1.20.

**Usual US (No AI):**
- Remains at the old baseline ⇒ DM_0 = 1.00, PT_0 = 1.00, NP_0 = 1.00, Y_0 = 1.00.

### 3.2. Intangible & Synergy at Year 0
- Top Labs: U_0 = 4.3, synergy φ_0 = 0.50, γ_0 = 0.50.
- Intermediate: U_0 = 2.0, synergy φ_0 = 0.20, γ_0 = 0.20.
- Bottom: U_0 = 1.0, synergy φ_0 = 0.05, γ_0 = 0.05.
- IT Sector: U_0 = 3.0, φ_0 = 0.35, γ_0 = 0.35.
- Usual US (No AI): synergy does not apply.

## 4) Iteration from Year 0 to Year 10

### 4.1. Partial AI (Years 1–8)
Each year, labs update:

U_{t+1} = U_t + I_{U,t}/(1+e^(−κ(U_t−5))).

φ_{t+1}, γ_{t+1} grow from low to near 1.0 as U crosses 5.

AI automation fraction grows from 57% at t = 0 to ~100% by Year 10.

Innovation (discovered materials, etc.) updates via a synergy-based factor.

Lockout Risk = logistic function of intangible gap vs. the best performer.

### 4.2. Full AI (Years 9–10)
Y_F = [φK_AI]^(1−α) ∑x_i^α, Ȧ_F = δA^θ [γK_AI,R]^η, L_Y, L_A ≈ 0.

### 4.3. No-AI Group
Stays in classic Romer: Ȧ_old = δAL_A.

No synergy jump. No intangible threshold.
We track their final output the same way we do in the standard Romer framework (some modest growth from knowledge accumulation, but no "AI multiplier").

## 5) Consolidated Multi-Category Table
Below is a condensed table. We show only the key columns to keep it readable. Each row is a year. For AI adopters (Top, Intermediate, Bottom, IT), we show synergy (φ,γ), intangible U(t), discovered materials (DM_t), etc. For the No-AI group, we show the old-model output as a reference.

Note: The numeric jumps are plausible examples once we tie intangible investment to the R&D intensities in your summary. In actual production usage, you would run a program (e.g., Python, R) that systematically updates these each year.

### Table Legend

- **DM** = Discovered Materials index (vs. pre-AI baseline).
- **PT** = Patent index.
- **NP** = New Product Lines index.
- **Y** = Final Output (vs. old model baseline).
- **Lockout** = A "risk index" or probability in [0,1]. For the No-AI group, we don't define lockout risk because they have chosen not to adopt AI.

For each AI adopter, we track partial AI (Years 1–8) → full AI (Years 9–10).

Below, an abbreviated 5-year snapshot (Years 0,3,5,8,10). You can easily expand it to all 11 rows (0–10).

**Notes on the Table:**

- Lockout Risk for each AI-adopter category is measured vs. Top Labs intangible. If the intangible gap is large, risk is closer to 1. If the gap narrows, risk drops.
- Bottom Labs never meaningfully raise U; synergy φ ≈ 0.15 by Year 10. So their final output is ~1.15, meaning +15% from pre-AI baseline. Their lockout risk is still high (~0.75).
- IT Sector invests intangible heavily, crossing Ū = 5 by Year 3. They eventually achieve synergy near 1.00 by Year 10, output ~2.80 vs. the old baseline.
- Usual US (No AI) grows via standard Romer knowledge accumulation; final output up to ~1.50 by Year 10, which is less than top synergy labs or advanced IT can achieve with partial→full AI.

## SCENARIO (1): Vary κ in the S-Curve
We compare Low κ = 0.5 vs. High κ = 2. The higher κ is, the more abrupt the intangible jump (and thus synergy jump) after crossing Ū = 5.

**Setup for the Example:**
- We use a "Top Lab" style investment: R&D ~20% of revenue, skill λ = 0.9.
- Initial intangible U_0 = 4.0.
- Each year, intangible invests an amount scaled to 20% of revenue. We do a short iteration for Years 0–5 to illustrate how intangible & synergy differ.
- We produce two side-by-side tables, each with 6 rows (Years 0–5).
- Column ΔU shows how intangible increments each year, φ_t is synergy for final output, Y(t) is final output vs. a pre-AI baseline of 1.0.

### (1A) Low κ = 0.5 (Smooth Accumulation)

| Year | U(t) | Increment ΔU                                      | phi_t | Output Y_t |
|------|------|--------------------------------------------------|-------|------------|
| 0    | 4.0  | --                                               | 0.45  | 1.40       |
| 1    | 4.4  | 0.4 = I_U,1 * [1 / (1 + e^(-0.5(4.0-5)))]        | 0.50  | 1.50       |
| 2    | 4.8  | 0.4                                              | 0.55  | 1.60       |
| 3    | 5.2  | 0.4                                              | 0.60  | 1.70       |
| 4    | 5.7  | 0.5 (once above 5, bigger increment)             | 0.70  | 1.85       |
| 5    | 6.4  | 0.7                                              | 0.75  | 2.00       |

Because κ = 0.5 is low, the logistic slope near U = 5 is not too steep. The intangible increments increase moderately after crossing 5. By Year 5, intangible = 6.4, synergy φ = 0.75. Output ~2.00× baseline. Gains are meaningful but relatively "smooth."

### (1B) High κ = 2 (Abrupt Leap)

| Year | U(t) | Increment ΔU                                      | phi_t | Output Y_t |
|------|------|--------------------------------------------------|-------|------------|
| 0    | 4.0  | --                                               | 0.45  | 1.40       |
| 1    | 4.3  | 0.3 = I_U,1 * [1/(1 + e^(-2(4.0-5)))]            | 0.48  | 1.48       |
| 2    | 4.7  | 0.4                                              | 0.52  | 1.55       |
| 3    | 5.3  | 0.6 (once near 5, bigger jump)                   | 0.65  | 1.75       |
| 4    | 7.0  | 1.7 (huge leap after crossing threshold)         | 0.90  | 2.30       |
| 5    | 8.4  | 1.4                                              | 0.95  | 2.50       |

As soon as U crosses 5, the logistic factor 1/[1+e^(-2(U-5))] shoots up. So intangible jumps from 5.3 → 7.0 in just 1 year. Synergy leaps from 0.52 to 0.65, then to 0.90. Output soars from 1.55 to 2.30 in one year.

**Comparison:** High-κ yields a more "winner-takes-most" dynamic. Once you pass the threshold, intangible & synergy accelerate dramatically, creating big gaps between labs that cross early vs. those that remain stuck at U < 5.

## SCENARIO (2): Split AI for Production vs. R&D
We now partition K_AI(t) into (phi × K_AI,prod) for production vs. (gamma × K_AI,R) for R&D. We want to see how final output vs. knowledge growth changes if we shift that fraction. Below is a 3-case example for a single lab over 5 years (partial AI). We track final output and knowledge index (A) at Year 5.

**Base:** α = 0.5, δ = 0.05, θ = η = 1 for simplicity.

**Year 0:** A_0 = 1.0, intangible U_0 = 3.5. Each year, the lab invests intangible and grows synergy from 0.40 → 0.90 if crossing threshold. K_AI(t) is fixed growth from 100 → 200 by Year 5 (example). We just vary fraction to production vs. R&D.

### Table: Splitting AI Capital

| Case | %K_AI for Prod vs. R&D                                | Y_5  | A_5  |
|------|-------------------------------------------------------|------|------|
| (A)  | 80% Prod, 20% R&D                                     | 2.10 | 1.30 |
|      | phi*K_AI,prod=0.8K_AI, gamma*K_AI,R=0.2K_AI           |      |      |
| (B)  | 50% Prod, 50% R&D                                     | 1.90 | 1.60 |
|      | phi*K_AI,prod=0.5K_AI, gamma*K_AI,R=0.5K_AI           |      |      |
| (C)  | 20% Prod, 80% R&D                                     | 1.65 | 1.90 |
|      | phi*K_AI,prod=0.2K_AI, gamma*K_AI,R=0.8K_AI           |      |      |

**Interpretation:**
- (A) yields highest final output short-run (Year 5) but only moderate knowledge.
- (C) invests more AI in R&D → bigger knowledge (A=1.90) but smaller immediate Y=1.65.
- (B) is intermediate.

**Policy Relevance:** Over-weighting production AI can yield immediate gains but hamper long-run knowledge expansion and future innovation. Over-weighting R&D can pay off eventually, but short-run output is smaller.

## SCENARIO (3): Zero–One Labor Shock at a Surprise Date
We forcibly remove almost all labor at Year 5 (instead of planned Year 9–10). Two labs:

- **Lab A:** Intangible ~4.8 by Year 4, nearly crossing threshold Ū = 5.
- **Lab B:** Intangible ~2.5 by Year 4, far below threshold.

At Year 5 exactly, labor L_Y, L_A ≈ 0. We see final output at Year 6:

### Table: Surprise Full-AI at Year 5

| Lab | Year4 U(4) | Year4 phi(4) | Output(4) | Year5:Labor=0 | Year6 phi(6) | Output(6) |
|-----|------------|--------------|-----------|---------------|--------------|-----------|
| A   | 4.8        | 0.55         | 1.65      | Switch->FullAI| 0.90         | 2.40      |
| B   | 2.5        | 0.25         | 1.10      | Switch->FullAI| 0.10         | 0.60      |

**Explanation:**
- Lab A, intangible near 5 => synergy leaps to ~0.90 => output 2.40.
- Lab B, intangible only 2.5 => synergy ~0.10 => output collapses to 0.60.

This scenario shows how timing can produce abrupt winners vs. losers. Labs near intangible threshold can skyrocket once labor is removed and AI capital takes over; labs below threshold cannot exploit AI effectively.

## SCENARIO (4): Sectoral Full AI Only
We have two sectors:
- **Software Sector:** switches to full AI at Year 5.
- **Manufacturing Sector:** stays partial or old Romer.

Assume both start Year 0 with intangible ~2.5, but software invests intangible heavily (~15% R&D), manufacturing invests ~3%. We check intangible, synergy, output at Year 5 & Year 10.

### Table: Sectoral Differences

| Sector                  | R&D% | Year5 U(5) | Year5 phi(5) | Year5Out | Year10 U(10) | Year10 phi(10) | Year10Out |
|-------------------------|------|------------|--------------|----------|--------------|----------------|-----------|
| Software(Full AI@5)     | 15%  | 5.1        | 0.65         | 1.60     | 8.5          | 1.00           | 2.80      |
| Manufacturing(Partial)  | 3%   | 3.0        | 0.20         | 1.10     | 4.0          | 0.35           | 1.30      |

At Year 5, software intangible hits 5.1 => synergy ~0.65 => they jump to full AI => output=1.60. By Year 10, intangible=8.5 => synergy=1.0 => output=2.80.

Manufacturing invests intangible lightly => synergy remains 0.20–0.35 => output ~1.30. Skilled labor/capital also flows to software, deepening the gap.

## SCENARIO (5): Stop–and–Go Intangible Investment
We simulate a "boom–bust" intangible pattern vs. a "steady" pattern from Year 0–8. Each invests the same total intangible over 8 years, but timing differs:

- **Boom–Bust:** invests heavily in Years 1–2, then zero in Years 3–5, partial in Years 6–8.
- **Steady:** invests a moderate, consistent amount each year.

We show intangible each year, synergy, output at Year 8. Both labs start with U_0 = 2.0, Ū = 5, κ = 1.

### Table: Stop-and-Go vs. Steady

| Year | Boom–Bust(U_t) | Steady(U_t)  | phi_BB vs phi_Steady | Output(8)     |
|------|----------------|--------------|----------------------|---------------|
| 0    | 2.0 (start)    | 2.0 (start)  | 0.20 vs 0.20        | Both ~1.05    |
| 1    | 3.0 (heavy)    | 2.4 (mod)    | 0.28 vs 0.23        |               |
| 2    | 4.2 (heavy)    | 2.8 (mod)    | 0.40 vs 0.28        |               |
| 3    | 4.2 (0 invest) | 3.2 (mod)    | 0.40 vs 0.32        |               |
| 4    | 4.2 (0 invest) | 3.7 (mod)    | 0.40 vs 0.38        |               |
| 5    | 4.2 (0 invest) | 4.3 (mod)    | 0.40 vs 0.45        |               |
| 6    | 4.6 (modest)   | 4.9 (mod)    | 0.45 vs 0.55        |               |
| 7    | 5.2 (modest)   | 5.4 (mod)    | 0.60 vs 0.65        |               |
| 8    | 5.8 (modest)   | 6.0 (steady) | 0.70 vs 0.75        | 1.80 vs 1.90  |

Boom–Bust crosses the threshold at Year 7 (U = 5.2) => synergy leaps from 0.45 to 0.60.

Steady crosses threshold slightly earlier (U ≈ 5.4 at Year 7) => synergy ~0.75 by Year 8 => final output 1.90 vs. 1.80.

The difference might not be huge if both eventually cross threshold, but the steady approach yields a faster synergy ramp and slightly higher Year 8 output. If the bust period is longer (e.g., zero intangible from Years 3–7), the boom–bust lab might never cross threshold, creating a big gap. The details depend on how large and how long the "bust" is.
